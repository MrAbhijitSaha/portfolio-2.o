I'm
Abhijit
Saha,
a
motivated
Frontend Developer
from
Kolkata.
I
am
driven
to
build
fresh and dynamic
web
applications
that
are
responsive,
visually appealing, and
most importantly
provide a seamless
user
experience.
As
a
developer,
I always
enjoyed
working with
tools
such as React
,
Next.js
,
Tailwind CSS
,
and
ShadCN UI
to
bring
ideas to live on the web
because of their
beautiful
flexibility and
potential,
allowing me to create
with clean code and mindful design to make the best use of the technology
I genuinely
enjoy
building and designing
interfaces and more
than simply writing
code, I enjoy building
interfaces that incorporate
cognitive and emotional intent
to create delightful interactions that delve into my identity and
concept of who
I am.
I am constantly striving to learn
new
tools, systems and workflows
and getting the opportunity to work and collaborate with a team
to devise solutions to problems while striving to build impactful
digital
products and to build a career in web development. 
When I am not programming or coding,
I am usually researching design approaches or looking for personal side projects to educate myself and
improve my knowledge to stay current in the space."
