						text="Hello,
						I'm
						Abhijit
						Saha,
						a
						motivated
						Frontend Developer
						from
						Kolkata.
						I
						am
						driven
						to
						build
						fresh and dynamic
						web
						applications
						that
						are
						responsive,
						visually appealing, and
						most importantly
						provide a seamless
						user
						experience.
						As
						a
						developer,
						I always
						enjoyed
						working with
						tools
						such as React
						,
						Next.js
						,
						Tailwind CSS
						,
						and
						ShadCN UI
						to
						bring
						ideas to live on the web
						because of their
						beautiful
						flexibility and
						potential,
						allowing me to create
						with clean code and mindful design to make the best use of the technology
						I genuinely
						enjoy
						building and designing
						interfaces and more
						than simply writing
						code, I enjoy building
						interfaces that incorporate
						cognitive and emotional intent
						to create delightful interactions that delve into my identity and
						concept of who
						I am.
						I am constantly striving to learn
						new
						tools, systems and workflows
						and getting the opportunity to work and collaborate with a team
						to devise solutions to problems while striving to build impactful
						digital
						products and to build a career in web development. 
						When I am not programming or coding,
						I am usually researching design approaches or looking for personal side projects to educate myself and
						improve my knowledge to stay current in the space."
